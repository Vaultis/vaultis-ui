# Welcome to Vaultis

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed with [`vercel`](https://vercel.com)

**Stack:**  `typescript` + `nextjs` + `tailwinds` + `mui (material ui)` + `storybook`

**Extra settings:** `eslint` + `cssnano`(css compression) + `prettier` + `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

## Demo
- Production Site: https://vaultis-ui.vercel.app
- Storybook: https://vaultis-ui-git-main-vaultis.vercel.app/
  
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Storybook
Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation, allowing developers to build, test, and showcase individual components without the need for a full application. To run Storybook in a project, you can follow these steps:

Start Storybook using the command 

```bash
npm run storybook 
# or
yarn storybook
```

View your component stories in the Storybook UI at http://localhost:6006.

That's it! With Storybook, you can develop and test your UI components in isolation, making it easier to build and maintain a robust UI system.
